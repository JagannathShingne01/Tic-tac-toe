This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js. It allows two players to take turns and play the game on a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend and take turns on the same device.
- Interactive UI: Click on the squares to make your move.
- Winner Declaration: The game will automatically declare the winner when a player has won, or it's a draw.
- Reset: Start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Styling for the game board and UI elements.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/JagannathShingne01/Tic-tac-toe.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Tic-tac-toe`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and go to `(http://localhost:5173/)` to play the game.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to click on empty squares to place their symbol (X or O).
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all the squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
